# Top Bin ⚽️

**Top Bin** is a next-generation fantasy soccer platform designed to bridge the "scoring gap." Traditional fantasy sports over-index on goals and assists; Top Bin uses a weighted, multi-dimensional scoring engine to reward the true impact of players, including progressive passes, interceptions, and big chances created.

## 🚀 Vision
The "scoring gap" often ignores the contributions of world-class defensive midfielders or creative playmakers who don't always end up on the scoresheet. Our platform develops a transparent, flexible, and data-driven experience that reflects the actual flow of the "beautiful game."

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
* **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
* **API:** Real-time Match Data Integration

## 🎯 Project Goals
* **Custom Scoring Engine:** Design a logic layer to translate raw match data (tackles, key passes) into fractional points.
* **API Integration:** Fetch and normalize real-time match data, player stats, and fixtures.
* **Core Infrastructure:** Secure backend and dashboard-style frontend for squad management.
* **League Management:** Public/private league creation with live weekly/seasonal leaderboards.
